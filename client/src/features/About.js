            <p>This project was made to help people get the best deals on electronics at BestBuy. I personally always enjoy getting a deal on a product, but oftentimes I don't care to keep checking day after day to see whether a product is on sale or at the price I'd be willing to buy it at. This website makes that easy - just make a price watch and you'll automatically get an email when the price is right.</p>
            <p>This project was also partially inspired by BestBuy's price adjustment policy - if the price drops within the return period, they can get you the new sale price. Of course I never check the price after I've bought something, but this way I set it up to be alerted if the price drops below the price I bought it for.</p>
